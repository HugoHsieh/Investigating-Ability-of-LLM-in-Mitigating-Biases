# Investigating-Ability-of-LLM-in-Mitigating-Biases

Summary: Assessing LLMs' role in mitigating biases through gender stereotype analysis.

This is the final project of Data Science and Public Policy at Columbia University in 2024. I co-worked with Sophie Hsiao, Fiona Fang, and Jianfeng Chen. 

•	Incorporated word embedding techniques by training CBOW model with PyTorch on 110K sentences to capture and quantify gender stereotypes in occupational choice

•	Explored LLMs by examining stereotypes of LLM-generated corpora under various experimental settings to assess LLMs’ abilities in mitigating biases
