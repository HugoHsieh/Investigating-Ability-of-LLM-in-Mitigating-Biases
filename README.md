# Investigating-Ability-of-LLM-in-Mitigating-Biases

Summary: Assessing LLMs' role in mitigating biases through gender stereotype analysis.

This is the final project of Data Science and Public Policy at Columbia University in 2024. I co-worked with Sophie Hsiao, Fiona Fang, and Jianfeng Chen. 

•	Incorporated word embedding techniques by training CBOW model with PyTorch on 110K sentences to capture and quantify gender stereotypes in occupational choice

•	Explored LLMs by examining stereotypes of LLM-generated corpora under various experimental settings to assess LLMs’ abilities in mitigating biases

This is an ongoing project. Please see Proposal.pdf for more details about our initial thoughts. The final report would be uploaded here by late May.
